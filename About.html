        <h1>About the UAE</h1>

        <p>The UAE is classified among the countries with the highest rate of vulnerability to potential impacts of climate change in the world. 
            This will result in warmer weather, less precipitation, droughts, higher sea levels and more storms. 
            On the other hand, the economic boom and population growth increase the demand for energy, water and natural resources, which indirectly contribute to the levels of carbon dioxide emissions and climate change.</p>

        <p>The UAE plays a central role in the world’s energy economy as a supplier of fossil fuels, which gives the country an important stake in finding solutions to cutting emissions while still providing the world with the energy it needs. 
           In recent years, the UAE has deployed extensive efforts towards driving sustainability forward in the country under the framework of the UAE Vision 2021, Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, and in alignment with the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030, the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”).</p>

        <h2>UAE on Climate Change</h2>

        <p>The UAE has engaged in the fight against climate change because it recognises the risks of inaction and the global responsibility it is committed to. Due to concerns about climate change, the UAE commissioned international studies to assess the effects of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and changing weather patterns. 
            To highlight this importance, the UAE renamed the Ministry of Environment and Water to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment.</p>
          
        <p>The UAE has made strides in addressing climate change, but the country also faces challenges due to its reliance on oil and gas resources. Reducing emissions from these sectors remains a crucial aspect of the UAE's efforts to combat climate change.</p>

        <h2>UAE on Sustainability</h2>
          
        <p>To achieve a sustainable future, the country is taking collective action across various areas, including achieving net zero and conserving land and sea. 
            The year 2023 was dedicated to sustainability, under the theme, ‘Today for Tomorrow’. The ‘Year of Sustainability' included initiatives, activities and events that draw upon the UAE’s values of sustainability. 
            The UAE has always put sustainability at the heart of its development plans that Cop28 was hosted in the Emirates in 2023.</p>

        <p>The UAE has always been, and continues to be optimistic about the opportunity we have to build a better, more secure and more prosperous world. In the words of UAE Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan: “The preservation of our planet is not only a moral duty, but also an economic necessity.”</p>
